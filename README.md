# Libraries
> This repository is used to store all of the programming libraries made by me. All of the libraries include a commented tutorial on how to use them, but the functions may not be described at all. I to use the online version of the code or downloading the file and not editing it at all. That may cause the code to break and not function properly. All of the libraries are tested and I make sure that all of them work as intentioned. Mostly all of the libraries include some kind of error-display and/or error-handling. I recomment using the _min_ version of the libraries. Using the _dev_ versions may cause lag or slow processing of the code, however this doesn't apply to libraries with around 20 to 100 lines of code. All of the libraries are stored in their language categories and if needed they are in a folder for specific usage. That means a library for ROBLOX argument hadling will be in `LUA > ROBLOX > ArgHandler-min.lua`.

## Current list of languages:
 - **Lua** (_Usage:_ Roblox, General)
